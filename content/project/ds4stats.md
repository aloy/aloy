[Shonda Kuiper](https://www.grinnell.edu/users/kuipers), [Laura Chihara](http://www.people.carleton.edu/~lchihara/) and I developed a series of tutorials and case studies that can be used in a variety of courses to introduce data-scientific concepts. You can find these materials on [Github](https://github.com/ds4stats). 

This work was funded by grants from the Associated Colleges of the Midwest and the Teagle Foundation.
