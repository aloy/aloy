<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/21/upshot/election-2015-the-first-gop-debate-and-the-role-of-chance.html?abt=0002&amp;abg=1"><em>The Upshot</em></a> featured a nice article on the role of sampling variability in the selection of the 10 candidates invited to the first GOP debate. The post includes a nice visualization of simulated possible participants, assuming that basic polling data are “true”.</p>
<p>Students in an introductory statistics course, especially one using a simulation-based curriculum, would benefit from reading this story. The article is a great spring board for talking about simulation and sampling variability, and also illustrates that these topics are relevant!</p>
