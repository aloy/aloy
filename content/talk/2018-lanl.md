abstract = "Graphical methods are commonly used for exploratory data analysis and model checking in, however,  graphics are often criticized due to the subjectivity involved. Recently, a protocol that puts graphics into an inferential framework has been developed, allowing analysts to understand the extent to  which perceived structure in a plot occurs by chance. This talk will review  the development and implementation of this protocol and discuss it's two most compelling applications: estimating the power of competing visual designs; and diagnosing models when asymptotic results are not available."
