abstract = "The short paper describes the major findings of the ISU Statistical Graphics working group on airline traffic in the USA. Flight volumes at major airports are increasing. Delays decreased after structural changes in 2002-2003 but have been increasing again since and delays build up during the day reaching a peak in the early evening hours. There is some hint of wind direction and strength affecting delays. This article has supplementary material online."
