abstract = "Q-Q plots allow us to assess univariate distributional assumptions by comparing a set of quantiles from the empirical and the theoretical distributions in the form of a scatterplot. To aid in the interpretation of Q-Q plots, reference lines and confidence bands are often added. We can also detrend the Q-Q plot so the vertical comparisons of interest come into focus. Various implementations of Q-Q plots exist in R, but none implements all of these features. qqplotr extends ggplot2 to provide a complete implementation of Q-Q plots. This paper introduces the plotting framework provided by qqplotr and provides multiple examples of how it can be used."
