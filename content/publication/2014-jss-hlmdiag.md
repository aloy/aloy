abstract = "Over the last twenty years there have been numerous developments in diagnostic procedures for hierarchical linear models; however, these procedures are not widely implemented in statistical software packages, and those packages that do contain a complete framework for model assessment are not open source. The lack of availability of diagnostic procedures for hierarchical linear models has limited their adoption in statistical practice. The R package HLMdiag provides diagnostic tools targeting all aspects and levels of continuous response hierarchical linear models with strictly nested dependence structures fit using the `lmer()` function in the `lme4` package. In this paper we discuss the tools implemented in `HLMdiag` for both residual and influence analysis."
