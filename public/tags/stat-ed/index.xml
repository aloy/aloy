      <description>Shonda Kuiper, Laura Chihara and I developed a series of tutorials and case studies that can be used in a variety of courses to introduce data-scientific concepts. You can find these materials on Github.
This work was funded by grants from the Associated Colleges of the Midwest and the Teagle Foundation.</description>

      <description>The Upshot featured a nice article on the role of sampling variability in the selection of the 10 candidates invited to the first GOP debate. The post includes a nice visualization of simulated possible participants, assuming that basic polling data are “true”.
Students in an introductory statistics course, especially one using a simulation-based curriculum, would benefit from reading this story. The article is a great spring board for talking about simulation and sampling variability, and also illustrates that these topics are relevant!</description>
